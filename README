SchleudAR â€” Schleuder on ActiveRecord.
======================================

Does not include a web-interface, but provides a ready to use foundation for it.

Is slower starting up than schleuder-2, but more robust, modern and beautiful.
Comes with internationalized error-messages.

1. bundle install
2. bundle exec rake db:setup
3. bundle exec ./bin/schleuder-newlist list@host admin@example.org [/path/to/public.key]
4. bundle exec ./bin/schleuder-subscribe list@host user@example.net DEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEF /tmp/user.asc

Todo:
* Test if snailgun/snailgun-rr <https://github.com/sherriman/snailgun> might help speeding up startup.
* Make Plugins.
* Go through all the issues at <https://git.codecoop.org/schleuder/schleuder/issues> and consider fixing/implementing them.
* Make it a gem.
* Migrations-scripts for schleuder2-based lists.
