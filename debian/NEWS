  of dirmngr.
  To make use of this feature, specify a blank value in /etc/schleuder.yml:
  keyserver:

  In case schleuder was upgraded from a version < 3.0, all existing list data
  was moved to '/var/backup/schleuder'. 
  Please see '/usr/share/doc/schleuder/README.Debian' for details on how to
  migrate this data to be used with the current version.
