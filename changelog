schleuder (3.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Drop unnecessary dependency on init-system-helpers, as this is an
      essential package.
    - Explicitly depend on ruby-gpgme >= 2.0.13~: Up until 2.0.12, ruby-gpgme
      suffered from a bug which lead to false constructed key capabilities. In
      2013, the bug was found and a patch was written, but it took three more
      years for the patch to be included in a release.
    - Relax required rake version. This helps with backporting schleuder to
      stretch, and ensures a minimal delta between buster and stretch.
  * debian/NEWS: Add note about how to rely on the Debian keyserver defaults.
  * debian/patches:
    - Add patch to rely on the Debian keyserver defaults in the schleuder
      config. (Closes: #852710)
    - Drop patch to disable bundler, integrated upstream.
    - Refresh for release 3.2.1-1.
  * debian/ruby-tests.rake:
    - Disable bundler and test coverage check.
    - Don't kill gpg-agent before and after running the tests, integrated
      upstream.
    - Use random path for database and lists directory to prevent known
      tmpfile attacks.
  * debian/tests:
    - Explain why we aren't using haveged anymore, and instead, why we link
      /dev/random to /dev/urandom. Please, don't do this in production!
    - Accordingly, drop obsolete dependency on haveged.
    - Checking the status of the API is now possible without authentication.
      Therefore, update the expected response if querying the API status
      during autopkgtest.

schleuder (3.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/tests/upstream-tests: Drop starting haveged manually, because
    this doesn't work anymore, if invoked in a container. Instead, link
    /dev/random to /dev/urandom.
  * debian/ruby-tests.rake: Kill gpg-agent before and after running tests.
    This might help with making schleuder build reproducibly.

schleuder (3.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    the upstream provided tests, which rely heavily on entropy.

    start in containerized environments.
